1. Variant of interest:
	I found the Circus variant of Breakout interesting since unlike in other versions, where the player moves a platform of some sort in order to
	manipulate a single bouncing object's trajectory, the player moves an entire seesaw unit instead, affecting the trajectory of a second bouncing 
	object when the first comes back down. In other versions, players can only sort of direct the movements of multiple bouncing objects if the number
	of balls increases, but the movement of these additional balls isn't really fully under player control. If multiple objects bounce off each other,
    that's arbitrary, not intentional. Instead, in this version, the trajectory of one bouncing object is directly tied to another, and the player
    can effectively intentionally control both. I think that's fairly unique amongst all these variations and therefore interesting. The player isn't
    trying to get some primary object to bounce in a certain way, but rather to get a pair of objects to interact effectively.

2. Levels:
	For the first level, I want to lay blocks out around in a line fashion. This should be easier for the player, since a line of blocks won't be 
	hard to aim at. I want different types of blocks to be differently colored, and the layers should be arranged in color blocks, where the colors 
	form a pattern overall. 
	
	For the second level, I want to add a few more block types, and arrange the blocks in more of a lattice pattern, so the ball's movements will be
	harder to predict when it bounces off things, making the level harder. I also want to arrange the blocks more towards the bottom of the screen,
	again increasing difficulty for the player. The paddle size will decrease as well.
	
	For the third level, I'm going to add some final block types, and arrange middle blocks in a random pattern. The game's three upper walls will
	be lined in two perimeter layers this round: a safe layer of standard blocks, and an outside layer of black hole blocks, so that as the standard 
	blocks get destroyed the game gets harder.

3. Blocks:
	- Standard
		- Blocks that clear after one hit
		- Scores +1
	- Speed-increasing
		- Blocks that increase the speed of your ball when you hit them
		- Color of ball changes after hitting these blocks, speed change lasts until decreased by a speed-decreasing block
		- Increments speed by a factor of maybe x 1.5, hitting multiple of these blocks means your speed increases by x 1.5 each time
		- Scores +2
	- Speed-decreasing
		- Blocks that decrease the speed of the ball when you hit them
		- Color of ball changes after hitting these blocks, speed change lasts until increased by a speed-increasing block
		- Increments speed by a factor of maybe x 1.5, hitting multiple of these blocks means your speed increases by x 1.5 each time
		- Scores +1
	- Black hole
		- Blocks/patches that if hit will destroy your ball, bringing you one lost ball closer to losing
		- Disappear with ball when hit, so theoretically possible to "sacrifice" ball to get rid of block to ease future gameplay
	- Creation
		- Blocks that when hit disappear and launch an extra power-up ball at random speed/direction for certain time period
	- Instant-clear
		- Block that if hit will instantly clear the level, disappears after certain time period
		
4. Paddle:
	- Will bounce ball at perpendicular of angle it came at
	- Will increase length by magnitude of maybe 1.25 whenever next increment of ~10 points is scored (length will max out though)
	- Will have ball stay on it until launched at beginning of every level, launches ball at angle of mouse click
	- Warps from one side of screen to other

5. Power-ups:
	- Creation block that creates more balls
	- Every ~30 points scored, ball will become "fireball" and destroy not only blocks it touches but also blocks touching it either
	  by the side or the corner, lasts for a couple seconds
	- Every ~40 points scored, block will appear that if hit, will instantly clear level

6. Cheat keys:
	- Holding down s key will slow down ball by certain magnitude until released
	- Pressing c will clear the level

7. Extra:
	- Holding down a will accelerate ball speed by time, aka longer held down = faster ball goes, until released
	- I would argue this feature is substantial both because it involves a somewhat different calculation than all previous features, and also because
	  acceleration of this sort increases a sense of urgency in most games, changing the way the game feels/plays
